### Project overview

This project, is a little game named 2048. This game is a PUZ (Puzzle game). People can play the game to test their own thought. The way to win the game is going to get the number 2048. However, it will take time, strategy and maybe some luck. Most people could not reach 2048 on the first trial. But eventually they will always hit it.

The main frame of this game is very succinct. It has a large 2048 at the left corner on the top. Score and Best grade is nearby the title “2048”. Score records the score the player is having right now, and best records the highest grade he or she have ever gotten. There are some words under the title which is “join the numbers and get to the 2048 tile!”. Nearby those words, there is a button named New Game, and people can choose to click this button to start a new game. The next frame will be our gaming windows. 

For the gaming windows, you can move the number block by manipulating the direction button on the keyboard. You can move the same number block combine to get a new number block. And the content of the new number block will be the sum of the previous combined two number blocks. For example, if there are two number blocks which have number 2, I will combine them by using direction key on the key board. Then they can be 4. Next you must make another new 4, so you can combine these two 4 number blocks together. So that is the difficulties of the game. People may not have any plan to make those number together. And if a player wants to win the game, he has to have make one 2048 in the game. So how about losing the game, if a player moves lots of blocks, but before the numbers convert into a 2048, the blocks already filled all empty spaces, the player loses the game.
